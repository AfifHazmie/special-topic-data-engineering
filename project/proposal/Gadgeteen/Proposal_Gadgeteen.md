## 📒 Executive Summary
This proposal outlines a social media monitoring tool to understand public opinion and sentiment on ChatGPT in Malaysia. The main goal of the project is to develop a web application that can identify areas for improvement and potential new features for ChatGPT. The project's scope includes collecting and processing social media data from social medias using APIs, performing sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and developing machine learning algorithms to classify social media data based on sentiment.

ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI that is designed to generate human-like text in response to natural language inputs. As ChatGPT hits the market, it becomes crucial for us to understand public opinion and sentiment towards the platform. However, analyzing this data manually is time-consuming and often impractical. Therefore, there is a need for a platform that can monitor and analyze social media data in real-time to understand public opinion and sentiment on ChatGPT in Malaysia.
