## üìí Introduction
As the world becomes more aware of the impact of energy consumption on the environment, businesses and organizations are increasingly seeking ways to improve their energy efficiency. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through Energy Consumption Analysis. However, this process can be complicated, time-consuming, and difficult to track. This proposal outlines the development of an Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard that will simplify the process and provide real-time insights into energy consumption, enabling businesses and organizations to take informed decisions and improve their energy efficiency.

## üß± Background
Energy consumption analysis is the process of analyzing energy usage patterns to quantify the energy required by different systems in an organizations. By analyzing the energy usage, we can identify the energy consumption inefficiencies, thus provide alternative solutions to this problem. While conducting the analysis, data sources related to energy consumption of the organization is collected and analyzed to identify the areas of high energy consumption. Strategies to reduce energy usage are proposed based on the analysis. 

However, traditional methods of energy consumption analysis are problematic and inefficient as it does not provide real-time information causing workload increament and time-consuming. We may need to update the analysis manually once there is any update on the data. Traditional energy consumption analysis is also can be difficult to track and monitor because users are unable to interact with it. Users cannot see the previous version of the analysis. Besides, the way of presentation of the analysis is complicated and hard to study.

By implementing energy consumption analysis dashboard, an organization can save up their time and the workload of thier employees because the dashboard provides a real-time energy consumption analysis. There is no longer th need of updating the data manually. Furthermore, dashboard is a good tool to get an overview of energy consumption of the organization. It offers clear and readable data so that users can understand the analysis easily at a glance improving the user experience.

## üî¨ Objective
The goal is to develop an energy consumption analysis dashboard that makes it easier to analyze energy consumption, offers real-time information, and aids companies and groups in keeping track of their energy usage, spotting areas with high levels of consumption and waste, and taking proactive steps to increase efficiency.

- Create a dashboard for energy consumption analysis.
- Simplify the energy usage measurement procedure.
- Offer real-time information on energy consumption trends
- Make it simple and effective for companies and groups to keep track of their energy usage 
- Spot areas with high energy use and loss
- Be diligent in making improvements to energy economy.

## Scope
- This section should define the scope of the project, including the data sources to be used, the tools and technologies to be employed, and any other relevant information that will be needed to successfully complete the project.

## üîñ Methologies
The Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard will be developed using a combination of data analytics tools, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques. The dashboard will be designed to gather data from multiple sources, including energy meters, monitoring systems, and data loggers. The data will then be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in energy consumption, providing insights that can be used to make informed decisions.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Architecture
The Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard will be a web-based platform accessible from any device. It will be designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with customizable dashboards that can be tailored to the specific needs of individual businesses and organizations. The dashboard will provide real-time data on energy usage, costs, and efficiency, allowing businesses and organizations to identify areas of high energy consumption and waste, and take proactive measures to improve energy efficiency. It will also provide alerts and notifications to inform users of significant changes in energy consumption, enabling them to take immediate action.

## Risk and limitations
- Identify potential risks and limitations associated with the proposed data science project, including technical, financial, and legal risks.

- Provide a clear plan for mitigating these risks and limitations. This should include a risk management plan and contingency strategies.

## Deliverables and Milestones
Key deliverables and milestones:
1) Data collection and integration
* Based on the goals of our dashboard, data from different sources must be collected. For example, data from sensors, energy meters and building management systems. All of the data will be collected and integrated in the dashboard.
* Data visualization design
* User interface design
* Security and privacy
* Testing and deployment

Timelines and deadlines:


## üóÇÔ∏è Resources
The dashboard for energy consumption analysis requires the following tools:

- Software for data extraction and machine learning - Web development tools and platforms
- Energy meters, data collectors, and monitoring devices
- Cloud saving and storage services

## Technical Specifications
- Discuss the technical specifications of the proposed data science project, including data sources, data schema, data transformations, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and other technical details.

- Mention the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that will be used in the project.

- Provide details about the hardware and software requirements for the proposed system.

- Explain the data security measures that will be implemented.

## Timeline and Deliverables
- Provide a detailed timeline for the project, including milestones and deadlines.

- Specify the deliverables that will be provided at each milestone. It should also specify the expected time frame for each deliverable and the resources that will be required to complete the project.

- Explain the quality assurance and testing procedures that will be followed.


## üîç Conclusion
It is crucial to create an energy usage research panel in order to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy costs for businesses and organizations. Because it gives real-time views into energy use and pollution, it makes it easier to take preventative steps and reduce carbon effect. It is simple to measure and track energy consumption with the interface thanks to its accessibility from any device, which contributes to the development of a more sustainable future.
