## üìí Executive Summary
 Businesses and organisations are continuously looking for ways to boost their energy efficiency as Malaysians become more aware of their energy consumption and its effects on the environment. Therefore, energy consumption analysis is one of the most effective ways to accomplish this. However, this process can be complicated, time-consuming, and challenging to monitor. This proposal outlines the development of an energy consumption analysis dashboard that will streamline the process and provide real-time insights on energy consumption where the  expected outcomes enable businesses and organizations to take informed decisions and wise choices to improve their energy efficiency.

## üß± Background
 Energy consumption analysis is the process of analyzing energy usage patterns to quantify the energy required by different systems in an organizations. By analyzing the energy usage, we can identify the energy consumption inefficiencies, thus provide alternative solutions to this problem. While conducting the analysis, data sources related to energy consumption of the organization is collected and analyzed to identify the areas of high energy consumption. Strategies to reduce energy usage are proposed based on the analysis. 

 However, traditional methods of energy consumption analysis are problematic and inefficient as it does not provide real-time information causing workload increament and time-consuming. We may need to update the analysis manually once there is any update on the data. Traditional energy consumption analysis is also can be difficult to track and monitor because users are unable to interact with it. Users cannot see the previous version of the analysis. Besides, the way of presentation of the analysis is complicated and hard to study.

 By implementing energy consumption analysis dashboard, an organization can save up their time and the workload of thier employees because the dashboard provides a real-time energy consumption analysis. There is no longer the need of updating the data manually. Furthermore, dashboard is a good tool to get an overview of energy consumption of the organization. It offers clear and readable data so that users can understand the analysis easily at a glance improving the user experience.

## üî¨ Goals and Objectives
 The goal is to develop an energy consumption analysis dashboard that could ease the analysis process of energy consumption in Malaysia which offers real-time information, aids companies and groups in keeping track of their energy usage, spotting areas with high levels of consumption and waste as well as taking proactive steps to increase efficiency. The following objectives are the focus of our energy consumption analysis dashboard:

- To monitor real-time energy KPIs.
- To keep track of energy usage by individual utilities easily.
- To categorize energy costs based on different segments. 
- To determine areas with high energy consumption.
- To observe the variation in energy consumption of a specific period.

 This allows companies to focus their attention on reasons for high demand of energy and plan ways to control energy consumption and minimize costs.

## üßø Scope
 The development of an energy consumption analysis dashboard enables businesses and organizations to monitor their energy consumption easily and efficiently as the dashboard will provide real-time data on energy consumption and prices and offer actionable solutions to boost energy efficiency.

- The data source to be used in this project is through the [Malaysia Energy Information Hub (MEIH)](https://meih.st.gov.my/statistics) portal. This portal has a comprehensive of Malaysia's energy database such as crude oil & petroleum, natural gas and electricity.

- MongoDB's aggregation framework will be used as the main tool to extract insights from the data source and execute advanced queries and aggregations which involve pinpointing periods of high energy demand, examining unusual patterns of energy usage.

- Duration, type of industry and other appropriate features are used for analyzing the energy consumption trends via machine learning algorithms to create a model that can forecast energy usage, recognize trends and discover anomalies.

- By using visualisations, the outcomes from the energy usage analysis could be easily comprehend and the findings obtained can be used as opportunities to identify energy savings strategies to increase the efficiency of energy use.

## üîñ Methodology
 The Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard will be developed using MongoDB to analyze energy consumption patterns and identify opportunities for energy savings.

 To begin the project, all relevant data such as electricity usage and gas usage will be collected. After the data is collected, the data will undergo pre-processing process before it is analyzed. The tasks in data pre-processing include cleaning, filtering and data transforming to ensure the data is usable. Then, we will start to carry out data analysis to derive insights from the data. In order to achieve this task, we will be using MongoDB's aggregation to determine and analyze the peak demand period and energy consumption patterns by geographic location or demographic group or detecting anomalies in energy consumption. Next, we will identify what features will be used to analyze the energy consumption pattern. Example of the features may be used is time, weather and occupancy. After that, we will predict the energy demand and determine the energy efficiency opportunities by developing predictive models by using machine learning models and algorihtms such as linear regression, time-series forecasting or clustering. Finally, we will visualize the results of the analysis by using chart or graph so that we can understand the energy usage patterns and areas of energy savings easily.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Architecture
 
 Various tools and technologies will be combined to create the suggested system architecture. We will make use of the following to guarantee rapid and successful system development and deployment:

‚Ä¢ MongoDB: The system's data will be stored and managed using MongoDB. It is a NoSQL database that provides the scalability and freedom necessary for a system of this kind. MongoDB is a great option for our data management requirements because it also has an intuitive interface and a strong query language.

‚Ä¢ Hardware and software requirements: To support its complex data processing and analysis needs, the system will need high-performance hardware and software. This entails quick processors, lots of RAM, and SSD storage for quick data access. For a stable and secure setting, we will also use Apache web server and Linux-based operating systems.

‚Ä¢ Data visualization and analysis tools and frameworks: To visualise and examine the data from the system, we will employ a variety of structures and tools. These include live data analysis and visualisation tools like Jupyter Notebooks, data manipulation and analysis tools like Pandas, and data visualisation tools like D3.js.

To illustrate the system architecture, we have provided a flowchart below:

#### 
Last but not least, the proposed system design will be built using a combination of high-performance hardware and software, MongoDB, and tools and frameworks for data visualisation and analysis. This will provide the system with a stable and secure environment while ensuring effective data management, storage, and analysis.

## üí£ Risks and Limitations
 Although creating the energy consumption analysis dashboard will provide make our life more convienient, it still has its risk and limitations:

### üí∞ Financial Risk
 A huge investments may be needed for data aggregation, collection and storage. If there is no proper financial planning, projects managers may waste the money on unnecessary places. The project end up to be abandoned and unable to be completed causing the organization to lose benefits. Therefore, before starting this project, it is very crucial to specify the software and hardware will be used. The team who is responsible to the project must make a report to the project manager what software that may need to subscribe and what hardware may need to purchase. With this detailed financial report, there will be no waste of money on unnecessary places.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Risk
 One of the most serious technical risk is not having the right data. As we all know, the data sources chosen to carry out the analysis is very important in a data science project. When choosing a data source, the analytics team must think of the following aspects:

- How to ensure the data security?
- Is there a bias in underlying data?
- Can you use the data in an ethical and legal manner in your anticipated use case?
- Are you able to process the data on a timely and cost-effective basis?
- Is the data clean? If not, are you able to clean it?
- Do you know whether the data drift over time?

 Therefore, it is suggested that the analytics team should lay down internal protocols including policies, checklists and reviews to enforce proper data usage.

### üìë Legal Risk
 This kind of risk happens when the analytics team is given freedom to take any data sources that are relevant are needed to do their job. In this case, it may cause the violence of security, privacy and confidentiality due to the illegal use of the data. Although it is normal to give the permissions to the employees to access the data, it is also very risky as we cannot guarantee that they may intend to use it to do something illegally. In the end, the company has to bear the consequences and it may be very problematic. However, this risk is easier to control compare to other risks. It is suggested that the company only gives the permissions to access the data to one or two of the team members only, but not the whole analytics team. This will help the company to have a better control on the data security, privacy and confidentiality.
