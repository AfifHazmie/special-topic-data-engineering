## üìí Introduction
As the world becomes more aware of the impact of energy consumption on the environment, businesses and organizations are increasingly seeking ways to improve their energy efficiency. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through Energy Consumption Analysis. However, this process can be complicated, time-consuming, and difficult to track. This proposal outlines the development of an Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard that will simplify the process and provide real-time insights into energy consumption, enabling businesses and organizations to take informed decisions and improve their energy efficiency.

## üß± Background
Energy consumption analysis is the process of analyzing energy usage patterns and identifying opportunities for energy savings. This process can involve collecting and analyzing data on energy consumption, identifying areas of high energy consumption, and developing strategies to reduce energy usage. However, traditional methods of energy consumption analysis are often manual and time-consuming, and can be difficult to track and monitor.

## üî¨ Objective
The goal is to develop an energy consumption analysis dashboard that makes it easier to analyze energy consumption, offers real-time information, and aids companies and groups in keeping track of their energy usage, spotting areas with high levels of consumption and waste, and taking proactive steps to increase efficiency.

- Create a dashboard for energy consumption analysis.
- Simplify the energy usage measurement procedure.
- Offer real-time information on energy consumption trends
- Make it simple and effective for companies and groups to keep track of their energy usage 
- Spot areas with high energy use and loss
- Be diligent in making improvements to energy economy.
