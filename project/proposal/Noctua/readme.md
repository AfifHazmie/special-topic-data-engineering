  <h1>Project Proposal: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOL :wrench:</h2>
</div>

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool is a data science project that involves processing and analyzing natural language data such as text and speech. MongoDB is a suitable database for NLP projects because it provides a flexible and scalable platform for storing and processing large volumes of unstructured text data.
