## Key components
The following are the key components of a data science project proposal:

## üìë Executive Summary:

Restaurant reviews from Google are often used to survey places for customers that want to try that place out. We will perform an analysis on the reviews to determine whether it is positive or the opposite. From the analysis, we can conclude if a customer was satisfied with the service that was offered by the restaurant. Users who are searching for restaurants or places to eat will be able to find one not only by the ratings, but also with added criterias and information given or extracted from the review.

In today's fast-paced society, people are constantly on the go and looking for convenient places to grab a quick meal or drink. Cafes have become a popular choice for people who want to relax, work, or socialize while enjoying a cup of coffee or a tasty treat. However, with so many cafes to choose from, it can be challenging for customers to find the right one that meets their needs and expectations.

Other problem include rating systems that usually do not tell the whole story, sentiment and feeling of reviewer towards the cafe. With this system, we will extract more information to users through text analysis algorithms.

As a result, `customer satisfaction` has become a crucial factor in the success of cafes. In this project, we aim to monitor the Google reviews about customer satisfaction on cafes in Johor using NLP. NLP is a subfield of `artificial intelligence` that deals with the interaction between computers and human language.

However, existing rating systems that usually do not tell the whole story, sentiment and feeling of reviewer towards the cafe. With this system, we will extract more information to users through text analysis algorithms.

By analyzing the text data from Google reviews, we can `identify the common themes and sentiments` expressed by customers, such as the quality of food and beverages, the level of service, the ambiance, and the value for money. We can also `extract insights` on specific aspects of customer satisfaction, such as the frequency of positive and negative reviews, the average rating, and the most common keywords used.

Overall, this project aims to provide insights into the customer satisfaction of cafes in Johor and help cafe owners and managers make data-driven decisions to `improve their services and offerings`.

## ü•Ö Goals and Objectives

Problem Statement:
Customer reviews do not always show the true meaning. It can make other customers misunderstand the views of those customers who might want to try the cafe. Newer customers might find some reviews unreliable after trying out themselves. There are also some people who wanted to downgrade the cafe by intentionally giving negative reviews. The cafe owner also might want to improve their services thus, a reliable review might help them. 

The significance of this project lies in its potential to provide valuable insights into the customer satisfaction of cafes in Johor. Cafe owners and managers can use these insights to improve their services and offerings, such as by addressing specific complaints or negative feedback, enhancing the quality of their products, and improving the overall customer experience.

- To determine whether the reviews were positive or negative. 
- To determine the most ordered and recommended meal from each cafe.
- To analyze the percentage used word based on the reviews. 
- To train a model that can successfully identify a positive or negative review
- To ensure the review made by users is reliable based on our model‚Äôs outcome 

In this project, we aim to monitor the Google reviews about customer satisfaction on cafes in Johor using Natural Language Processing (NLP). .

## üç° Risks and Limitations:
- Potential Risks and Limitations:
  1. `Technical risks:` The data collected from Google reviews may not be accurate, complete, or up-to-date. Also, the analysis of such data requires expertise in data analytics and statistical techniques. There may be issues with data privacy, such as sensitive customer information being exposed. Moreover, sometimes words cannot fully predict the actual sentiment of a person towards said cafe. For example, a person may make some complaints about what they do not like about the cafe, however they still rate it highly in the rating section.
  2. `Financial risks:` The cost of collecting, processing, and storing data may be higher than anticipated. There may also be unexpected expenses, such as the need for additional hardware or software. For the time being, only free softwares or tools will be used in this project. There are several options to scrap data easily using paid software but we will not go for that route, as for now.
  3. `Legal risks:` These actions may be infringing on intellectual property rights or data privacy laws while collecting and using the data. It is essential to ensure that these actions are compliant with local regulations and that you have obtained the necessary permissions.

- Plan for Mitigating Risks and Limitations:
  1. `Technical:` Mitigate technical risks by ensuring that the data collected is from reliable sources, and validated the data by cross-checking it against other sources. It is best to engage experts in data analytics and statistical techniques to help with the analysis. It would help if you also implemented data privacy measures to protect sensitive customer information.
  2. `Financial:` Mitigate financial risks by setting a realistic budget and having contingency plans for unexpected expenses. Also, explore open-source tools and resources that can help you reduce costs.
  3. `Legal:` Mitigate legal risks by ensuring that these works comply with local regulations and obtain the necessary permissions before collecting and using the data. Working with legal experts to understand any potential legal risks and to develop strategies to mitigate them.

## üéì Conclusion:
We believe our data science project is in fact crucial for both business and tourism in Johor. On the business side of things, cafe owners can use our analysis to improve the services if a complaint was made by a customer. It can be done much more efficiently as we could identify an actual helpful review which could be difficult by doing it manually. On the tourism side, tourist can actually recommend the cafes to their friends which could boost tourism even more. However, this can only be done if they actually had an amazing time so a good and reliable review would definitely help. However, we do not expect the project will sailing smoothly as there would be some challenges which we would expect to arise such as the model not working as intended. Fortunately, we could always ask our lecturer for any assistance.
