  <h2>Key components</h2>
The following are the key components of a data science project proposal:

  <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
Restaurant reviews from Google are often used to survey places for customers that want to try that place out. We will perform an analysis on the reviews to determine whether it is positive or the opposite. From the analysis, we can conclude if a customer was satisfied with the service that was offered by the restaurant. Users who are searching for restaurants or places to eat will be able to find one not only by the ratings, but also with added criterias and information given or extracted from the review.

In today's fast-paced society, people are constantly on the go and looking for convenient places to grab a quick meal or drink. Cafes have become a popular choice for people who want to relax, work, or socialize while enjoying a cup of coffee or a tasty treat. However, with so many cafes to choose from, it can be challenging for customers to find the right one that meets their needs and expectations.

Other problem include rating systems that usually do not tell the whole story, sentiment and feeling of reviewer towards the cafe. With this system, we will extract more information to users through text analysis algorithms.

As a result, `customer satisfaction` has become a crucial factor in the success of cafes. In this project, we aim to monitor the Google reviews about customer satisfaction on cafes in Johor using NLP. NLP is a subfield of `artificial intelligence` that deals with the interaction between computers and human language.

However, existing rating systems that usually do not tell the whole story, sentiment and feeling of reviewer towards the cafe. With this system, we will extract more information to users through text analysis algorithms.

By analyzing the text data from Google reviews, we can `identify the common themes and sentiments` expressed by customers, such as the quality of food and beverages, the level of service, the ambiance, and the value for money. We can also `extract insights` on specific aspects of customer satisfaction, such as the frequency of positive and negative reviews, the average rating, and the most common keywords used.

Overall, this project aims to provide insights into the customer satisfaction of cafes in Johor and help cafe owners and managers make data-driven decisions to `improve their services and offerings`.

<h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>

Problem Statement:
Customer reviews do not always show the true meaning. It can make other customers misunderstand the views of those customers who might want to try the cafe. Newer customers might find some reviews unreliable after trying out themselves. There are also some people who wanted to downgrade the cafe by intentionally giving negative reviews. The cafe owner also might want to improve their services thus, a reliable review might help them. 

The significance of this project lies in its potential to provide valuable insights into the customer satisfaction of cafes in Johor. Cafe owners and managers can use these insights to improve their services and offerings, such as by addressing specific complaints or negative feedback, enhancing the quality of their products, and improving the overall customer experience.

- To determine whether the reviews were positive or negative. 
- To determine the most ordered and recommended meal from each cafe.
- To analyze the percentage used word based on the reviews. 
- To train a model that can successfully identify a positive or negative review
- To ensure the review made by users is reliable based on our modelâ€™s outcome 

In this project, we aim to monitor the Google reviews about customer satisfaction on cafes in Johor using Natural Language Processing (NLP). .
