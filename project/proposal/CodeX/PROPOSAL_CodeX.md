## Executive Summary
Netflix, YouTube, Spotify and many more streaming platforms have been introduced to the world as the technologies are advancing rapidly nowadays. With this being said, users are prone to use it almost everyday whenever they wanted to watch movies or tv shows and stream any music. The objective of this project is to create a system that display the best suggestion of musics or shows on streaming platform. The system we proposed will implement the usage of MongoDB as a database that can keep track on the user behavioral data which will then be processed using machine learning to recognize streaming patterns of each user so that the most relevant suggestion can be presented to the users to increase the users satisfactory.

> Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes. 

## Background
- As Netflix is one of the streaming platform , it uses Netflix Recommendation Algorithm (NRA) , to analyze user behaviour. Personalization is the key to success in today consumer world because it grabs consumer attention towards Netflix. Netflix Recommendation Algorithm (NRA) uses personalization based on 
these informations :


1)Time duration of a viewer watching a video.

2)Viewing history.

3)How titles were rated by the user.

4)Other users who may have similar tastes.

5)Information about titles such as genre, actors and release year.

6)The time of day you watch.

7)When the user watches a scene more than once.

8)If the show was paused, rewound, or fast-forwarded.

9)If the viewer resumed watching after pausing.

10)The device you are watching on.

11)The number of searches and what is searched for.

12)Screen shots when the show was paused.

13)When the user left the show

## Goals and Objective
1) Implement the usage of MongoDB to create recommendation engine
2) Be able to understand steps of using MongoDB to create recommendation engine, which are Data Collection , Data Cleaning, Data Transformation , Data Loading , Model Training and Recommedation Generation based on study case (Netflix)


## Scope
- This section should define the scope of the project, including the data sources to be used, the tools and technologies to be employed, and any other relevant information that will be needed to successfully complete the project.
- 

## Methodology
-Technique will used :

1) Data Collection : collect data from sources such as Netflix Recommendation Algorithm (NRA). This data will be used to train the reccomendation model
2) Data Cleaning : clean the collected data to removed irrelevant data or incomplete data such as null in user watching video period.
3) Data Transformation : Transform the cleaned data into format(____) used by MongoDB
4) Data Loading : Load transformed data into MongoDB collections
5) Model Training : Trains the recommendatiob model using machne learning algorithm based on data collected in steps 1
6) Recommendation generation : Generate recommendations for users based on their previous interaction with the system.
