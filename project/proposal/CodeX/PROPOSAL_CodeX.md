## Executive Summary
Netflix, YouTube, Spotify and many more streaming platforms have been introduced to the world as the technologies are advancing rapidly nowadays. With this being said, users are prone to use it almost everyday whenever they wanted to watch movies or tv shows and stream any music. The objective of this project is to create a system that display the best suggestion of musics or shows on streaming platform. The system we proposed will implement the usage of MongoDB as a database that can keep track on the user behavioral data which will then be processed using machine learning to recognize streaming patterns of each user so that the most relevant suggestion can be presented to the users to increase the users satisfactory.

> Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes. 

## Background
- As Netflix is one of the streaming platform , it uses Netflix Recommendation Algorithm (NRA) , to analyze user behaviour. Personalization is the key to success in today consumer world because it grabs consumer attention for the best experience and interaction towards Netflix. Netflix Recommendation Algorithm (NRA) create personalization based on 
these informations :


1)Time duration of a viewer watching a video.

2)Viewing history.

3)How titles were rated by the user.

4)Other users who may have similar tastes.

5)Information about titles such as genre, actors and release year.

6)The time of day you watch.

7)When the user watches a scene more than once.

8)If the show was paused, rewound, or fast-forwarded.

9)If the viewer resumed watching after pausing.

10)The device you are watching on.

11)The number of searches and what is searched for.

12)Screen shots when the show was paused.

13)When the user left the show

## Goals and Objective
1) Implement the usage of MongoDB to create recommendation engine
2) Be able to understand steps of using MongoDB to create recommendation engine, which are Data Collection , Data Cleaning, Data Transformation , Data Loading , Model Training and Recommedation Generation based on study case (Netflix)

The objective of recommendation engines such as Spotify and Apple Music is to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their listening history, preferences, and behavior. By analyzing large amounts of data about user interactions with music, recommendation engines can generate personalized playlists and song suggestions that are more likely to resonate with each user's individual taste.

The primary goal of these recommendation engines is to enhance the user experience by providing users with a more personalized and engaging listening experience. By offering tailored recommendations, these platforms can increase user engagement, retention, and loyalty, as well as increase the likelihood of users discovering new music and artists that they enjoy.

In addition to improving the user experience, recommendation engines also provide value to the platform itself. By increasing user engagement and retention, these engines can drive more revenue through subscription fees, advertising, and other means.

Overall, the objective of recommendation engines such as Spotify and Apple Music is to provide a more personalized and engaging experience for users while also driving business value for the platform.

**Data Security**
- Encryption: Encryption is the process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it. All sensitive data, including user data, machine learning models, and system logs, should be encrypted during storage and transmission. Encryption can be implemented using industry-standard protocols such as AES, SSL, and TLS.

- Access control: Access control is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the user's identity, role, and permissions. Access to sensitive data should be restricted to only authorized personnel who require access to perform their duties. Access control policies can be implemented using techniques such as role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).

- Authentication and Authorization: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the user's identity and permissions. All users, including system administrators, should be required to authenticate before accessing the system. Authentication can be implemented using techniques such as password authentication, two-factor authentication (2FA), or biometric authentication. Authorization can be implemented using access control policies.

- Data Backup and Recovery: Regular backups of sensitive data should be taken to ensure that data can be recovered in case of any data loss, corruption or disaster. Backup and recovery policies should be put in place, and backup data should be stored in a secure and encrypted location.

- Audit trails: An audit trail is a record of system activity that can be used to trace security breaches, detect unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with data security regulations. An audit trail should be implemented to track all system activity, including user logins, data access, and data modification.

- Regular security audits: Regular security audits should be performed to identify vulnerabilities, address security concerns, and ensure that security policies and procedures are being followed. Security audits can be performed internally or by third-party security firms.
