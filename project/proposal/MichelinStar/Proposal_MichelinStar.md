## üìÑ Executive Summary

From year to year, the more and more disease have been discovered and spread across the world. Some of the diseases are non-communicable causes by bad habits from new generation. The amount of patient suffereing from the disease have been increasing drastically but due to financial status most of them not able to affort expensive healthcare treatment. This have becoming the main focus from government to tackle this problem. 

Therefore, this proposal outlines the benefits of incorporating predictive analytics into healthcare analytics platforms for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. By leveraging predictive analytics, healthcare organizations can anticipate patient needs, prevent adverse events, and optimize resource utilization, resulting in better patient outcomes and reduced cost.


## üåé Background

Healthcare is a data-intensive industry, generating vast amounts of data on patients, clinical procedures, and operations. However, this data is often siloed and underutilized, resulting in missed opportunities for improving patient care and reducing healthcare costs. The emergence of healthcare analytics platforms has provided a solution to this problem by enabling healthcare organizations to collect, store, analyze, and derive insights from their data.

Healthcare analytics platforms use various analytical techniques to derive insights from data, including descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, prescriptive analytics, and predictive analytics. Descriptive analytics involves summarizing past data to understand what happened, while diagnostic analytics involves analyzing past data to determine why something happened. Prescriptive analytics involves recommending actions based on past data, while predictive analytics involves forecasting future outcomes based on past data.

Predictive analytics, in particular, is gaining prominence in healthcare analytics platforms as it can help healthcare organizations anticipate patient needs, prevent adverse events, and optimize resource utilization. For example, predictive analytics can be used to identify patients at risk of readmission or adverse events and provide timely interventions to prevent such events. It can also be used to optimize resource utilization by predicting patient demand and resource needs, enabling healthcare organizations to allocate resources efficiently.

The benefits of predictive analytics in healthcare are well-documented, with several studies demonstrating its potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. For example, a study conducted by the University of Chicago Medicine found that a predictive model for sepsis reduced the rate of sepsis-related deaths by 53% and reduced hospital length of stay by 4.4 days. Another study by the Mayo Clinic found that a predictive model for hospital readmissions reduced readmissions by 10%.

Given the potential benefits of predictive analytics in healthcare, there is a growing need for healthcare organizations to adopt predictive analytics platforms. However, implementing predictive analytics in healthcare is not without its challenges, including data privacy and security concerns, technical complexity, and the need for skilled resources to develop and maintain the platform. Nevertheless, with the right strategy and approach, healthcare organizations can overcome these challenges and unlock the full potential of predictive analytics in healthcare.


## üéØ Goals and Objectives

The goal of the healthcare analytics platform is to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and optimize resource utilization through predictive analytics. To achieve this goal, the platform will have the following objectives:

- To collect and integrate healthcare data.
- Develop predictive models using advanced analytics techniques.
- Provide actionable insights customized to the needs of healthcare providers.
- To Support clinical decision-making with real-time clinical decision support.
- Monitor and evaluate platform performance to continuously improve outcomes.

By achieving these objectives, the healthcare analytics platform will improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and optimize resource utilization. The platform will enable healthcare providers to make informed decisions about patient care and resource allocation and will help healthcare organizations to achieve their strategic goals.
