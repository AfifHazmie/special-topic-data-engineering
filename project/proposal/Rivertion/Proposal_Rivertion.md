Medical imaging plays a crucial role in modern healthcare for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. In Malaysia, the demand for medical imaging services has been growing due to an aging population and increasing incidence of chronic diseases. However, the shortage of qualified radiologists, coupled with the increasing complexity of medical images, has led to delays in diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and suboptimal treatment outcomes.

Interpreting medical images is a challenging task that requires expert knowledge and experience. Radiologists are trained to identify subtle differences in images that may indicate a disease or condition, but this process can be time-consuming and subject to human error. Additionally, the growing volume of medical images being generated presents a significant challenge to radiologists, as it increases their workload and reduces the amount of time they can spend on each case.

The proposed data science project aims to address these challenges by developing a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system that can assist radiologists in analyzing medical images. By leveraging machine learning algorithms trained on a large dataset of annotated medical images, the system can identify patterns and anomalies in images that may be indicative of a disease or condition. The system can then provide radiologists with a preliminary diagnosis or highlight areas of concern, reducing the time and effort required to analyze images and improving the accuracy of diagnosis.

The potential benefits of the proposed CAD system are significant. By improving the speed and accuracy of diagnosis, the system can reduce the time required for patients to receive treatment, which can be critical in cases where time is of the essence. Additionally, the system can help reduce the workload of radiologists and improve their efficiency, allowing them to spend more time on complex cases that require their expertise. Finally, the system can also help address the shortage of qualified radiologists by enabling healthcare providers to diagnose and treat more patients with existing resources. Overall, the proposed CAD system has the potential to significantly improve healthcare outcomes in Malaysia and enhance the quality of medical imaging services.


## üéØ Goals and Objectives:

## üõë Risks and Limitations:

Even though analyzing medical images for disease diagnosis gives a lot of advantages both to doctors and patients, this process also poses several risks and limitations that should be considered. Below are points for technical, financial and legal risks:

<ol>
	<li> Technical Risks: </li>
<ul>
  <li> Accuracy of the analysis: Analyzing medical images needs for specialized equipment in terms of technology, specifically AI. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the analysis is based on the image quality, the radiologist or specialist's experience and expertise, and the technology's quality. Improper treatments or delayed diagnosis are the possible outcomes of wrong diagnosis.</li>
  <li> Security and privacy: The most private aspects of a person are their health information. Medical images contain sensitive patient information, including personal health information. Unauthorized disclosure may result in several discrimination and a breach of basic rights. Certain kinds of data processing may result in the infringement of personal rights and interests. As the context of their processing may pose serious threats to basic rights and freedoms, personal data, which are by their very nature highly sensitive in connection to those rights and freedoms, warrant special protection.</li>
</ul>
	<li> Financial Risks: </li>
<ul>
  <li> Cost: Medical image analysis may be costly, especially for cutting-edge technology like MRI or PET scans. The price of the software, maintenance, and hardware may be costly, which may have an impact on how much people must pay for healthcare.</li>
  <li> Return on investment: For certain patients or medical professionals, the expense of medical image analysis could exceed the advantages. Alternative diagnostic techniques occasionally may be less expensive and yield comparable or superior outcomes.</li>
</ul>
	<li> Legal Risks: </li>
<ul>
  <li> Liability: Medical image analysis is a crucial procedure with important patient consequences. Healthcare professionals or radiologists who diagnose ailments incorrectly or fail to spot problems run the danger of being held accountable.</li>
  <li> Regulatory compliance: Medical image analysis is subject to regulation by healthcare authorities, such as the Malaysian Medical Council. Providers must ensure that they are complying with regulations related to medical image analysis and patient privacy.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
