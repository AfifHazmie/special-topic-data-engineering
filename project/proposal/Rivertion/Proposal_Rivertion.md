## 1. Executive Summary

- Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.


## 2. Background:

- Provide a background to the problem that the proposed data science project aims to solve. This should include a clear explanation of the current situation, the problems faced, and the potential benefits of the proposed solution.


## 3. Goals and Objectives:

- Provide a brief introduction about the project, its objective, and its significance. These should be measurable and tied to the overall business objectives of the organization.
- Describe the problem statement that needs to be solved.


## 4. Scope: 

<ul>
  <li>The scope of this project is to develop an AI system for the analysis of chest X-ray images of pediatric patients.</li>
  <li>The dataset comprises 5,863 high-quality X-Ray images (JPEG) of anterior-posterior view, with 2 categories - Pneumonia and Normal, which are organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contain subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, with the URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.</li>
  <li>The main tool to be employed in this project is 3D Slicer. In addition, various tools and technologies such as machine learning algorithms, deep learning frameworks, image processing libraries, and cloud-based computing resources will be used to develop the AI system.</li>
  <li>The chest X-ray images were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou. The images were initially screened for quality control, and all low-quality or unreadable scans were removed from the dataset. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians, with the evaluation set checked by a third expert to account for any grading errors.</li>
  <li>The successful completion of the project will enable accurate and efficient diagnosis of chest X-ray images in pediatric patients, contributing to improved clinical outcomes and patient care.</li>
</ul>
