## üìú Executive Summary

Playgrounds are an essential part of any community, providing children with an outlet for physical activity, socialization, and play. As such, it is crucial to ensure that these playgrounds are safe and in good condition. This project aims to develop a predictive maintenance system for playground equipment inspection and maintenance. By leveraging data collected from playground surveillance footage, the system will be able to identify potential maintenance issues and predict when maintenance will be required, allowing for more efficient and effective playground upkeep.


## üìù Background:

</p>

Playgrounds are often the focal point of outdoor play for children in communities across the world. As such, it is crucial that playground equipment is maintained in good working order to prevent injuries and ensure the equipment's longevity. However, traditional maintenance practices for playground equipment can be reactive, relying on periodic inspections and repairs after issues arise. This approach can be time-consuming, costly, and may not prevent equipment failures or hazards.

Moreover, environmental factors such as exposure to the sun, wind, rain, and snow can cause significant wear and tear on playground equipment. Other factors such as heavy usage, vandalism, and equipment age can also contribute to the degradation of equipment. Furthermore, these factors may vary from one location to another, making it challenging to predict when and where maintenance will be required.

Predictive maintenance for playground equipment inspection and maintenance involves the use of  and data analytics to identify potential maintenance issues before they become critical problems. This approach enables maintenance personnel to schedule proactive maintenance tasks that can prevent equipment failures and injuries. Moreover, it can help reduce maintenance costs by prioritizing maintenance activities based on need rather than a rigid schedule.

The implementation of a predictive maintenance system for playground equipment inspection and maintenance requires the collection of data from surveillance footage from CCTV's placed around the playground. From the footage, physical damages should be visible and easily detected. The data collected can then be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and predict when maintenance will be required. The system can then alert maintenance personnel of potential maintenance needs before critical issues arise.

In summary, predictive maintenance for playground equipment inspection and maintenance can provide several benefits over traditional reactive maintenance practices. It can help reduce maintenance costs, increase equipment lifespan, and improve overall safety. By using the images captured from the footage and data analytics to predict maintenance needs, playground equipment can be proactively maintained, and potential hazards can be prevented.


## üéØ Goals and Objectives:

Goals:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance system for playground equipment inspection and maintenance. This system will be able to collect visual data from the surveillance footage captured from the CCTV's around the playground. The data collected will then be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and predict when maintenance will be required. The goals of this project are as follows:

1. Identify the key parameters that impact the health and safety of playground equipment.
2. Develop a data collection system using images captured by CCTV's in the playgrounds vicinity.

</ul>
	<li> Financial Risks: </li>
<ul>
  <li> Equipment and software costs: Implementing predictive maintenance requires an initial investment in equipment sensors, software, and other hardware. The cost of these components can be significant, depending on the size and complexity of the playground equipment.</li>
  <li> Maintenance costs: Predictive maintenance can help reduce maintenance costs by predicting failures before they occur. However, there is still a cost associated with maintaining the equipment sensors, software, and other hardware components, as well as conducting the necessary repairs and replacements.</li>
</ul>
	<li> Legal Risks: </li>
<ul>
  <li> Liability: Playground equipment is subject to safety regulations and standards, and failure to comply with these regulations can result in legal liabilities. Implementing predictive maintenance can help reduce the risk of safety hazards, but it does not eliminate the need to comply with safety regulations and standards.</li>
