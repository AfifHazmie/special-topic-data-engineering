## üìñ: Executive Summary 
Consumer segmentation that prioritizes product attributes involves categorising customers into groups according to their needs or preferences for particular product features. To find customer groups with comparable traits and preferences, it entails examining data on customer behaviour, purchase history, demographics, and product preferences. (chosen bussiness)¬†¬†can adjust their marketing initiatives and product offers to fit the unique needs of each consumer segment by understanding their needs and preferences, which will boost customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## üñºÔ∏è: Background
Today, it is a no brainer that every market is highly competitive. All businesses that are competing in each of these markets are going beyond reach to get an edge over their competitors. One of the tools used by businesses today to reap profits today is customer segmentation.
<br><br>
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a company's customer base into specific groups or segments based on shared characteristics, behaviors, and needs. The concept of this process has evolved over time, but it can be traced back to the early days of marketing when businesses began to realize that not all customers were the same and that different groups of customers had different needs and preferences.
<br><br>
As time passed, data science eventually became the new technology to help businesses to improve on all aspects. Now, businesses use the help of data science to companies can tailor their marketing strategies and messages to better reach each segment of customers.
<br><br>
The system that is proposed here, aims to segment customers into groups using clustering and potentially other methods to several groups. This would allow business decisions to be catered to one or many customer segments. Thus, allowing any individual or organisation that uses it to posses an advantage over their competitors.

## üîé: Goals and Objectives
In order to enhance marketing and sales strategies, boost customer satisfaction and retention, and ultimately spur business growth, it is important to better understand and target certain groups of customers based on their traits, requirements, and habits.

1. Using data from demographics, psychographics, behaviour, and preferences, identify unique client categories.
2. Examine client data to comprehend the requirements and buying habits of each category.
3. Create marketing campaigns and messages that are relevant to each demographic.
4. Design tailored experiences for each group to increase client happiness and adherence.
5. Evaluate and assess segmentation strategies' efficacy to continuously enhance and hone strategies.
6. Understanding and applying MongoDB to develop a recommendation engine 

Customer segmentation enables organisations to more fully comprehend their customers and deliver individualised experiences that may increase customer loyalty, pleasure, and return on investment (ROI)

## üî¨: Scope
The objective of this project is to improve an organisations performance in terms of decision making and customer overall experience. With this known, the scope of this project will be :

- **Data Source** : In this project, dataset from ``not determined`` will be used
- **Tools & Technologies** : ``how to get data``, and store it in MongoDB. Which then will be cleaned and prepared using `Pandas`, `Numpy` and `MongoDB Aggregation`. Clustering algorithms using `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` and `PyTorch` libraries will be applied on the cleaned data. Findings will be visualised using `Tableau` or `PowerBI`.
- **Resources** : 
  - Team of 5 people.
  - Each team member posses skills from gathering appropriate data to visualising data, using tools and technologies listed.
  - Adequate hardware and software to progress.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è: Methodology
- ``Data collection`` : Gather information on customer preferences, product features with age and gender preferences, and other pertinent information using the data scraping method. 

- ``Data cleaning and processing`` : The collected data will be cleaned, filtered, pre-processed to remove duplicate data.

- ``Data analysis`` : Data analysis utilizing descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis methods comes after the data have been cleaned. This will make it easier to spot patterns and trends in the information.

- ``Machine learning algorithms`` : Based on the gathered data, machine learning algorithms can be utilized to anticipate the customer choice. Hence, can build a model utilizing supervised learning methods like regression or classification.

- ``Data visualization`` : Use data visualization approaches to illustrate the relationship between product feature patterns, analysis, and machine learning algorithms. Tools like Tableau and Python packages like Matplotlib and Seaborn can be used for this.


## üíª: System Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:
1. ``Data acquisition: `` Customer information will be gathered from a variety of sources, including marketing campaigns, website analytics, and social media platforms, by the data acquisition component. Real-time data collection and storage in a centralised database will make it simple to obtain the information.

2. ``Data storage:`` **MongoDB** will be the main database used by the data storage component to store and manage the customer data. A NoSQL database called MongoDB offers adaptable data formats and simple scalability. A cloud-based server will host the database to guarantee high availability and data protection.

3. ``Data preprocessing:`` The component of data preprocessing will clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. Duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant features will be removed. Preprocessing will also include feature engineering, such as the creation of new variables that extract meaningful information from the data.

4. ``Data analysis and modeling:`` The data analysis and modelling component will identify customer segments based on their behaviour, preferences, and demographics by employing various statistical and machine learning techniques. Python and its data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn will be used for the analysis. The models will be trained using MongoDB customer data and validated using cross-validation techniques.

5. ``Model deployment:`` **Django**, a Python-based web framework, will be used by the model deployment component to deploy machine learning models to a web server. Predictions based on user input will be provided via API endpoints. Setting up a continuous integration and delivery pipeline will also be part of the deployment to ensure that the models are up to date and accurate.

6. ``Model monitoring and maintenance:`` The model monitoring and maintenance component will continuously monitor the models' performance and retrain them as needed. MongoDB's change stream feature, which provides real-time notifications when data changes, will be used for monitoring. Updating the models to account for new data sources and changing customer behaviour will be part of the maintenance.

7. ``Visualization and reporting`` The visualisation and reporting component will create interactive dashboards and reports using data visualisation tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Matplotlib. Stakeholders will be able to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer retention, acquisition, and engagement using these dashboards.

8. ``Workflow and collaboration:`` To track progress, assign tasks, and collaborate with team members, the workflow and collaboration component will use project management tools like **Trello** or **Asana**. In addition, the team will use version control software such as Git to ensure that all changes to the codebase are tracked and easily reversible.
