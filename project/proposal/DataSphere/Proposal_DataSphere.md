## Executive Summary 
-Consumer segmentation that prioritizes product attributes involves categorising customers into groups according to their needs or preferences for particular product features. To find customer groups with comparable traits and preferences, it entails examining data on customer behaviour, purchase history, demographics, and product preferences. (chosen bussiness)Â Â can adjust their marketing initiatives and product offers to fit the unique needs of each consumer segment by understanding their needs and preferences, which will boost customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Background
- Provide a background to the problem that the proposed data science project aims to solve. This should include a clear explanation of the current situation, the problems faced, and the potential benefits of the proposed solution.

## Goals and Objectives
In order to enhance marketing and sales strategies, boost customer satisfaction and retention, and ultimately spur business growth, it is important to better understand and target certain groups of customers based on their traits, requirements, and habits.

1. Using data from demographics, psychographics, behaviour, and preferences, identify unique client categories.
2. Examine client data to comprehend the requirements and buying habits of each category.
3. Create marketing campaigns and messages that are relevant to each demographic.
4. Design tailored experiences for each group to increase client happiness and adherence.
5. Evaluate and assess segmentation strategies' efficacy to continuously enhance and hone strategies.
6. Understanding and applying MongoDB to develop a recommendation engine 

Customer segmentation enables organisations to more fully comprehend their customers and deliver individualised experiences that may increase customer loyalty, pleasure, and return on investment (ROI)

## Scope
- This section should define the scope of the project, including the data sources to be used, the tools and technologies to be employed, and any other relevant information that will be needed to successfully complete the project.

## Methodology



## System Architecture
- Provide a detailed overview of the proposed system architecture including the tools and technologies that will be used to develop and deploy the system
- Explain how the data will be stored, managed, and analyzed using MongoDB, as well as the hardware and software requirements needed to support the system.
- Discuss the tools and frameworks that will be used for data visualization and analysis.
- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

## Risks and Limitations
- Identify potential risks and limitations associated with the proposed data science project, including technical, financial, and legal risks. 
- Provide a clear plan for mitigating these risks and limitations. This should include a risk management plan and contingency strategies.

## Technical Specifications

| Technical Specifications |                                  Details                                  |
|:------------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       Data sources       | Extracted data from various APIs                                          |
|        Data schema       | The data will be stored in MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database. The data schema will be designed based on the data structure and requirements. The schema will be flexible to allow for changes and updates in the data.  |
|   Data transformations   | Python, Pandas, Numpy, MongoDB aggregation                                                   |
|       ML algorithms      | Python libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch)                                      |
| Data visualization tools | Power BI/Tableau, Python visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly) |
|   Programming Languages  | SQL, Python, pymongo (Python driver for interacting with MongoDB)    |

Hardware and Software Requirements:
- The project will require a machine with sufficient RAM and CPU power to run the MongoDB server and the machine learning algorithms.
- The recommended hardware specification is a machine with 16GB RAM and an Intel i7 processor or equivalent.
- The software requirements include MongoDB, Python, and the necessary Python libraries.

Data Security Measures:
- The project will implement various security measures to protect the data and prevent unauthorized access.
- The MongoDB server will be configured to use SSL/TLS encryption to encrypt data in transit.
- Access to the MongoDB server will be restricted to authorized users with strong passwords.
- Data backups will be stored off-site in encrypted form.
