## üìÑ Executive Summary

Increasing internet penetration and smarter, more powerful devices have made Malaysia's e-commerce market among the strongest it has ever been. Consumers are increasingly flocking online to purchase products and services. This means Malaysia e-commerce statistics are crucial to the creation of effective content strategies for publishers and affiliate marketers targeting the country. 

Therefore, this project aims to produce an e-commerce analytics dashboard that helps to optimize e-commerce operations and to improve profitability by leveraging the insights provided by Shopee e-commerce data. Sales data will be used to identify which products are selling well and which are not, to understand seasonal trends and to optimize pricing strategies.


## üåé Background

An ecommerce analytics dashboard is a group of visualizations based on ecommerce store‚Äôs data. Most dashboards cover a specific goal or topic, such as traffic or audience behavior. Nowadays, it has become essential since the number of online users have increased dramatically and there is a growing shift from offline to online purchasing. The growth is supported by the rapid adoption of smartphones, growing internet penetration, and the availability of secure online payment systems. This situation causes the difficulty of monitoring online business as there are large amounts of transactions in a day and new strategies are needed to attract customer interest. 

Other than that, the increasing number of competitors is one of the problems with e-commerce. As a common habit, most of the customers will compare the price and quality at different platforms before buying the product. Therefore, it is important for businesses to come up with appropriate pricing strategies. 

By analyzing the sales data from Shopee, we can have greater efficiency because dashboards save time by showing us the most important metrics at a glance. It also allows decision-making faster since we won't have to wait on a report to get the relevant data and it presents all the relevant findings within a single pane. With only the most important data in focus, we will be better equipped to analyze the critical metrics in-depth.

In summary, this project aims to provide a sales analysis dashboard that gives insight about the sales data in order to help e-commerce platforms increase efficiency, enhance business strategy and higher profitability. 
  

## üéØ Goals and Objectives

Around 80% of eCommerce businesses have been failing because of insufficient marketing strategy and selling the wrong product at the wrong price. Therefore, an effective marketing plan is the key success of all businesses. The business owner has to collect sales data and then analyze it himself. Without doing this, the business owner cannot understand the current situation of the marketplace.

However, modern technology can help to solve this problem effectively. Therefore, the owner's time will not be wasted to the maximum extent. The sales performance analysis dashboard of our project target to achieve the following objectives. 

- To determine sales trends.
- To provide real-time information on sales.
- To monitor the most important metrics and KPIs
- To identify which products are selling well and which are not
- To optimize pricing strategies.

This will be significant for online sellers to track their progress and quickly respond to any changes by getting insights and analytics on e-commerce data. 
  

## üî≠ Scope

> This section should define the scope of the project, including the data sources to be used, the tools and technologies to be employed, and any other relevant information that will be needed to successfully complete the project.

This project will develop an e-commerce analytics dashboard to analyze the sales performance of Shopee in order for businesses to obtain valuable insights and look to optimize their online sales and marketing efforts.
- The data that will be used in this project is collected from <a href="https://shopee.com.my/">Shopee</a> Malaysia. It is an e-commerce platform that sells a variety of categories of products like Home & Living, Health & Beauty and Electronics.
 
- Web scraping tool is used to extract product information from Shopee. The extracted data will be processed and analyzed. 

- MongoDB is important to store and analyze data since it contains a powerful aggregation framework to analyze the sales data. For example, the aggregation pipelines can be used to group the data by product, customer, or time period and calculate metrics such as total sales, average order value, and customer lifetime value.

- Visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau are considered to help business owners to understand the sales data and support data-driven decisions.


  

## üîç Methodology

- Explain the methodology and the techniques that will be used in the project. Provide a detailed methodology that outlines how the proposed data science project will be executed, including data collection and cleaning, data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques.

- Explain how the data will be collected and processed.

- Discuss the software and hardware resources that will be required for the project.

  

## üîß System Architecture

## üìä Risks and Limitations

- Identify potential risks and limitations associated with the proposed data science project, including technical, financial, and legal risks.

- Provide a clear plan for mitigating these risks and limitations. This should include a risk management plan and contingency strategies.

Data Availability: The availability of data is a significant restriction. The suggested project might need data that is hard to get or might not be available. Data may be accessible in some circumstances, but its acquisition may be prohibitively expensive.

Data Quality: Although the data may be accessible, there may be problems with the data's quality. The quality of the outcomes may be impacted by the data's potential for being erroneous, inconsistent, or incomplete.


Another danger is scope creep, in which the project's goals may change from what was originally planned. As a result, more effort and resources would be needed, which might have an impact on the project's budget and schedule.
