## üß≠ Executive Summary
The objective of this project is to develop a dashboard via web application for credit card fraud detection. The system will use MongoDB as the database to store and machine learning algorithms will be employed to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent. Dashboard will be tailored to provide relevant insights based on the management level of the company.

The importance of credit card fraud detection cannot be overstated as it has a significant impact on the financial security and reputation of companies. The consequences of not detecting and preventing fraud can result in significant financial losses and damage to the company's reputation, which can lead to a loss of customer trust. The expected outcome of this project is an effective fraud detection system that can help companies reduce the risk of financial losses due to fraudulent activity and improve their overall financial security.

## üå± Background:

TikTok has become one of the most popular social media platforms for sharing short-form videos. While TikTok's categorization and recommendation algorithm is generally effective at providing relevant and engaging content to users, it can face some challenges due to the vast amount of content on the platform. 

The proposed solution to this problem is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately categorize TikTok videos into relevant categories, such as dance, comedy, music, cooking, sports, and many more. To do this, we will use web scraping to gather data from TikTok and extract features such as video captions, hashtags, and user comments. By using a combination of video and text features, the model can capture the unique characteristics of each video and make more accurate predictions about its category. This can improve the overall user experience on TikTok by providing more personalized and relevant recommendations to users and helping content creators reach their target audience more effectively.

MongoDB can be used as a database to store the data collected through web scraping. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it ideal for storing and handling unstructured data, such as the features extracted from TikTok videos. By using MongoDB, we can easily store, query, and manipulate the data as needed to prepare it for machine learning. Lastly, the dashboard may content a video distribution by category, trending categories, top categories by engagement and many more.

This can lead to a more enjoyable and engaging experience on the platform, as users are more likely to discover videos that match their interests and preferences. Furthermore, for TikTok as a platform, it can lead to increased user engagement, retention, and revenue, as users spend more time on the app and engage with more content.


## üèÖ Goals and Objectives:
TikTok Insights Dashboard's primary goal is to provide TikTok creators with a complete picture of their account's performance and audience engagement. This is accomplished through the use of numerous metrics and data points that can assist creators in making informed decisions about their content strategy and understanding how their audience reacts to their material. With the help of informations from TikTok Insights Dashboard content creators, affiliates and marketing team can improvise their content to achieve their target audience and sales. In addition they also can optimize their content strategy, better engage with their audience, and grow their following on the platform. On top of that,

The TikTok insights dashboard project aims to solve these problem statements: 

- i. Limited visibility into performance -
It is tough for creators to tell how their work is performing on TikTok without analytics tools. They may know how many views their videos have, but they may not know how long users are watching them, what their engagement rate is, or how their content affects their following growth.

- ii. Difficulty detecting trends -
TikTok is a fast-paced platform, and keeping up with hot subjects and hashtags can be tough. Creators may miss out on opportunities to develop content that resonates with their audience and capitalises on popular trends if they do not use analytics tools.

- iii. Inability to measure success - 
Without analytics tools, content creators may be unaware of how successful their content is or what modifications they can make to increase interaction. This can lead to a loss of motivation and dissatisfaction for content creators who are attempting to grow their following and develop effective material.

- iv. Quality and completeness of data - 
To ensure the effectiveness of this system, the data must be accurate and complete. Data quality issues needs to be focused to made sure the system is reliable.

- v. Inadequate grasp of audience demographics -
Without data on their audience, creators may not know who is responding to their content or what changes they can make to better target their ideal audience. This can make it tough for them to develop material that will engage and grow their audience.

## üîç Scope:

## üìå Risks and Limitations:

There are several risks and limitations that need to be considered when building fraud detection dashboard:

 1. Technical Risks:
	   - Data Quality: May not have access to all the data needed to build an effective fraud detection dashboard. 	For example, some data may be restricted due to        privacy concerns. Incomplete, inconsistent or inaccurate data can lead to false positives or missed fraud cases.
 2. Financial Risks:
	   -  Maintenance Costs: After the initial development dashboard, Ongoing maintenance and updates are required to ensure that the system remains effective. This can result in additional costs, such as software upgrades, data storage, and data processing.
	   - Investment Costs: May require significant upfront investment in infrastructure, software, and personnel. There is a risk that the organization may not see a return on investment if the dashboard does not effectively detect and prevent fraud.
 3. Legal Risks: 
	   - Liability: Organizations may be held liable for fraudulent activities that occur within their systems, even if they are not directly responsible. This could  result in significant legal and financial costs.

 It is important to identify and mitigate these risks when building a fraud detection dashboard to ensure that the dashboard is effective, financially viable, and legally compliant. We can implement appropriate data security and privacy measures, engaging legal experts to review the dashboard's compliance with relevant regulations, and carefully evaluating the financial costs and benefits of the project.
