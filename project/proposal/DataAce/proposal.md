## :compass: Executive Summary
The objective of this project is to develop a real-time dashboard via web application for credit card fraud detection. The system will use MongoDB as the database to store and process large volumes of transactional data, and machine learning algorithms will be employed to identify fraudulent patterns and alert the appropriate personnel. The dashboard will be tailored to provide relevant insights and alerts based on the management level of the company.

The importance of credit card fraud detection cannot be overstated as it has a significant impact on the financial security and reputation of companies. The consequences of not detecting and preventing fraud can result in significant financial losses and damage to the company's reputation, which can lead to a loss of customer trust. The expected outcome of this project is an effective fraud detection system that can help companies reduce the risk of financial losses due to fraudulent activity and improve their overall financial security.

## :seedling:  Background:
- Provide a background to the problem that the proposed data science project aims to solve. This should include a clear explanation of the current situation, the problems faced, and the potential benefits of the proposed solution.

## :medal_sports: Goals and Objectives:
The system is designed to identify fraudalent transactions by analyzing a vast amount of historical as well as real-time data, looking for patterns and anomalies that indicate fraud and present the data in interactive dashboard for effective decision-making and analysis. The dashboard will provide valuable insights and analytics on fraudulent transactions, allowing for the identification of patterns and trends, as well as the development of strategies to avoid future frauds. The primary objective of this project are to prevent potential financial damages, minimize losses due to the fraudalent transactions and improving customer satisfaction thus providing them more secure and reliable payment platform.

The credit card fraud detection system project aims to solve these problem statements: 
- i. Identify the fraudulent transactions - Analyzing patterns from historical and real-time data as quickly as possible to prevent losses from fraud. This can minimize further losses.

- ii. Pattern recognition - Identifying patterns will made the system learn from past incidents and develop strategies to prevent future frauds.

- iii. Real-time monitoring - This can help detect fraudalent transactions as soon as they occur thus automatically prompt action to solve the issue.

- iv. Dashboard visualization - Provide a meaningful insights and the visualization is in user-friendly format. This will help relevant stakeholders such as fraud management team and customer service team to understand better and faster.

- v. Quality and completeness of data - To ensure the effectiveness of this system, the data must be accurate and complete. Data quality issues needs to be focused to made sure the system is reliable.

- vi. Performance optimization - The system should be capable of handling large volumes of transactions and quickly processing them in order to provide real-time alerts and insights.

## 	:mag: Scope: 
The objective of this system is to discern fraudulent transactions by analyzing a large amount of historal and real-time data which will enable users to gain insight for effective decision-making and analysis. Below contains the project scope statement which will help us achieve said objective.

- i. Data Sources

- ii. Tools and Technologies

- iii. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- iv. Reporting

## :open_book: Methodology:
This project will be using various research methods to achieve our main objective which is to build a system to detect fraudulent transactions. The table below presents the specified procedures, strategies, technologies and softwares used in this project. 

| Components | Description |
|--|--|
| Data Collection | collect data related to financial transactions or user behavior, including information such as transaction amount, location, timestamp, user information, and other relevant data.   |
| Data Pre-processing | cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data into a usable format. |
| Data Analysis | Use MongoDB's aggregation framework to perform complex queries and aggregations to derive insights from the data. This could include identifying patterns of fraudulent behavior such as unusual transaction amounts or abnormal frequency of transactions. |
| Feature Engineering | Identify the relevant features that you want to use to detect fraudulent activities. These features can include the transaction amount, the location, the time of the day, the user's device, or any other relevant characteristics. |
| Fraud Detection| Build a model that can predict fraudulent activities based on the features you have identified. You can also use rule-based approaches to detect specific types of fraudulent activities. |
| Visualization | Data visualization techniques such as charts or graphs to visualize the results of the fraud detection. |
| Fraud Alert System | Use the results of the fraud detection models to generate alerts or notifications for suspicious transactions, allowing businesses to take immediate action to prevent financial losses. |
| Interpretation | Use the insights gained from the analysis to improve your fraud prevention strategies, such as adding additional security measures or updating your fraud detection rules.
