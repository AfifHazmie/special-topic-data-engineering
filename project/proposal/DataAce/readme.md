</p>
<p> Credit card fraud is the act of using another person’s credit card to make purchases or request cash advances without the cardholder’s knowledge or consent. These criminals may obtain the card itself through physical theft, though increasingly fraudsters are leveraging digital means to steal the credit card number and accompanying personal information to make illicit transactions.

In this project, we will develop a web application to analyze transaction data and detect fraudulent behavior in real-time. The dashboard uses MongoDB to store and process large volumes of transactional data. Use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity and alert the appropriate personnel.</p>
