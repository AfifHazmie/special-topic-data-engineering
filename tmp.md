| 1 | Data Engineer, Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Scientist | Data Engineer, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Data Scientist are all related to handling and processing large amounts of data. Data engineering and data science are both parts of the data lifecycle, where data engineering focuses on building and maintaining the data infrastructure, while data science focuses on extracting insights from the data using various techniques. They all require a strong understanding of various tools and technologies used in data processing and analysis, such as SQL, Python, Hadoop, Spark, and cloud computing. They also require a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and programming concepts to perform their work effectively. |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod1.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>|

| 8 | Artificial Intelligence  vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning | Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are all related to the field of computer science and are focused on enabling computers to learn and make decisions based on data. Artificial intelligence involves building systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language understanding, decision making, and problem-solving. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms that can learn patterns and make decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to learn and identify patterns in data. Overall, all three fields involve leveraging data to build intelligent systems that can learn from experience and make decisions based on that learning.|<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod7.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 9 | Visualization| Relationships among analysis, design and implementation, object-oriented design using UML, object-oriented design principles, elaborating UML diagrams from analysis.|<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod7.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>|
