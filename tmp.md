| 1 | Data Engineer, Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Scientist | Data Engineer, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Data Scientist are all related to handling and processing large amounts of data. Data engineering and data science are both parts of the data lifecycle, where data engineering focuses on building and maintaining the data infrastructure, while data science focuses on extracting insights from the data using various techniques. They all require a strong understanding of various tools and technologies used in data processing and analysis, such as SQL, Python, Hadoop, Spark, and cloud computing. They also require a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and programming concepts to perform their work effectively. |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod1.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 2 | Data Integration | Data integration in data science is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a unified view for analysis. This involves identifying relevant data sources, transforming and cleansing the data to ensure consistency and quality, and integrating the data into a common format. Data integration tools automate the process of data integration and enable organizations to manage the entire data integration process, including data mapping, data transformation, and data quality. These tools can be categorized into three types: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), ELT (Extract, Load, Transform), and EAI (Enterprise Application Integration). Popular data integration tools include Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, Talend, Informatica PowerCenter, and Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services. These tools help organizations to streamline their data integration process, enabling data scientists to analyze data from multiple sources, and gain a comprehensive understanding of a particular phenomenon or problem. |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod2.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 3 | Types of Data & NoSQL Database | Data can be broadly categorized into two types: structured and unstructured data. Structured data is organized and formatted in a specific way that makes it easy to store and analyze using traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). Unstructured data, on the other hand, refers to data that does not have a predefined structure, such as text, images, videos, and audio files. NoSQL databases are a type of non-relational database that are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. There are several types of NoSQL databases, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases. Document-oriented databases such as MongoDB store data in flexible JSON-like documents, while key-value databases such as Redis store data as key-value pairs. Column-family databases such as Apache Cassandra store data in column families, and graph databases such as Neo4j are designed to handle highly connected data such as social networks. Each type of NoSQL database has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suited to different use cases depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the application. |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod3.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 4 | Data Scrapping | Types of requirements, functional and non-functional requirements, requirements specification, requirements engineering processes |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod4.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 5 | Data Wrangling | Use case modelling and specification, domain modelling, activity diagram, sequence diagram, state chart/state machine diagram |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod5.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>|
| 6 | Feature Engineering | Architectural design and detailed design, Architectural design decision, architectural view, component diagram in relation to architectural view, architectural pattern: Model-View-Controller (MVC), layered, repository, client server and pipe filter |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod6.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 7 | Application Programming Interface  (API) | Architectural design and detailed design, Architectural design decision, architectural view, component diagram in relation to architectural view, architectural pattern: Model-View-Controller (MVC), layered, repository, client server and pipe filter |<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod6.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 8 | Artificial Intelligence  vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning | Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are all related to the field of computer science and are focused on enabling computers to learn and make decisions based on data. Artificial intelligence involves building systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as language understanding, decision making, and problem-solving. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building algorithms that can learn patterns and make decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to learn and identify patterns in data. Overall, all three fields involve leveraging data to build intelligent systems that can learn from experience and make decisions based on that learning.|<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod7.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>| 
| 9 | Visualization| Relationships among analysis, design and implementation, object-oriented design using UML, object-oriented design principles, elaborating UML diagrams from analysis.|<a href="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/materials/sec01/mod7.md" ><img src="./images/markdownp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a>|
