# Visual Studio Code: develop web application using MongoDb and Django

To use Visual Studio Code to develop a web application using MongoDB and Django, you can follow these steps:

- Install MongoDB: First, you need to install MongoDB on your computer. You can download and install MongoDB from the official MongoDB website.

- Install Django: You also need to install Django, which is a Python web framework. You can install Django using pip by running the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
pip install Django
Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code: To get the most out of Django development in Visual Studio Code, you can install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code. You can do this by going to the Extensions view (Ctrl + Shift + X) and searching for "Python".

- Create a new Django project: To create a new Django project, open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command:

Copy code
``` python
django-admin startproject myproject
Replace myproject with the name of your project.
```

- Install the Django MongoDB Engine: To use MongoDB with Django, you need to install the Django MongoDB Engine. You can install it using pip by running the following command in the terminal:
Copy code
pip install djongo

- Configure the settings for your Django project: You need to configure the settings for your Django project to use MongoDB. Open the settings.py file in your Django project and add the following lines of code:
python
Copy code
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'djongo',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
    }
}

- Replace mydatabase with the name of your MongoDB database.

- Create a new Django app: To create a new Django app, open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command:
Copy code
python manage.py startapp myapp
Replace myapp with the name of your app.

- Define your models: Define your models in the models.py file in your Django app. You can use Django's model fields to define the fields for your MongoDB documents.

- Create the MongoDB collections: To create the MongoDB collections for your models, run the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Start the Django development server: To start the Django development server, open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command:
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
- This will start the development server, and you can view your Django project by opening a web browser and navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

That's it! You're now ready to start developing your web application using MongoDB and Django in Visual Studio Code.
