# Data Scraping

## Content:
- [Introduction]()
- [API and Web Scraping](../api/api-web-scraping.md)

Data scraping (also known as web scraping) refers to the automated process of extracting data from websites or other sources on the internet using software or tools. The data can be in various formats, such as text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.

Data scraping is important for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it can help individuals and organizations gather large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, which can be used for various purposes such as research, analysis, and decision-making. For example, businesses can use data scraping to gather pricing information on competitors' products or to extract customer reviews and feedback from e-commerce websites.

Secondly, data scraping can help to automate repetitive tasks, such as manual data entry, saving time and resources. This can be particularly useful for organizations that need to process large amounts of data on a regular basis.

Thirdly, data scraping can be used to monitor changes on websites or other sources in real-time, which can be useful for tracking news or social media trends, or for monitoring competitors' activities.

Overall, data scraping has become an essential tool for individuals and organizations seeking to gather and process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, allowing for more informed decision-making and improved efficiency. However, it's important to note that data scraping can also raise ethical concerns, particularly when it comes to the privacy and security of individuals' data.
