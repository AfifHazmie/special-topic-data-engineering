## Introduction
Software engineering is an essential field of study that deals with the design, development, and maintenance of software applications. It plays a vital role in the development and success of modern technology. Here are some of the reasons why software engineering is important:

## Data Integration Design
Data Integration design is the act of merging data from many sources into a unified perspective that can be easily accessed and analysed. The purpose is to provide a complete and accurate perspective of data to aid decision-making and business operations.

1. ``Gathering of requirements``: This entails comprehending the data sources, their formats, and the business requirements for data integration.
2. ``Data profiling``: In this step, the data is analysed to determine its structure, quality, and completeness.
3. ``Data mapping``: During this stage, data from various sources is mapped to a single data model. This entails determining the connections between the data and the attributes that must be incorporated.
4. ``Data transformation``: During this phase, the data is converted from its original format to a format that can be easily integrated.
5. ``Data quality validation``: Assessing the quality of the integrated data, including accuracy, completeness, and consistency checks.
6. ``Deployment``: In this phase, the combined data is deployed to the production environment.
