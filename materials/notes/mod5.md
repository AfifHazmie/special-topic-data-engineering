## What is Data Wrangling?
  Data wrangling, also referred to as data munging, involves the manipulation, cleaning, and restructuring of raw data to make it more accessible and suitable for analysis. With the ever-expanding volume and diversity of available data sources, the need to store and organize large amounts of data for analysis has become increasingly important.

  The process of data wrangling entails tasks such as reorganizing data, transforming its structure, and mapping it from its initial raw form to a more usable and valuable format for various downstream applications, including analytics.

  In essence, data wrangling can be described as the process of refining and preparing raw data by eliminating errors, organizing it effectively, and converting it into the desired format. This enables analysts to utilize the data efficiently for timely decision-making. Data wrangling, also known as data cleaning or data munging, offers several benefits to businesses, including the ability to handle complex data more efficiently, produce more accurate results, and make better-informed decisions. The specific methods employed in data wrangling may vary depending on the project requirements and the nature of the data involved. Increasingly, organizations are turning to data wrangling tools to streamline the preparation of data for downstream analytics.


## Importance of Data Wrangling
The use of data wrangling software has become indispensable in data processing. The primary importance of employing data wrangling tools can be summarized as follows:

1. ``Making raw data usable``: Accurate data wrangling ensures that high-quality data is fed into downstream analysis.
2. ``Centralizing data from various sources``: Data wrangling facilitates the consolidation of data from different sources into a centralized location for effective utilization.
3. ``Transforming raw data into the required format``: Data wrangling involves restructuring raw data according to the desired format while considering the business context.
4. ``Leveraging automated data integration tools``: These tools enable data wrangling techniques that clean and convert source data into a standardized format, allowing for repeated usage based on end requirements. Businesses rely on this standardized data for essential cross-data set analytics.
5. ``Cleansing data from noise, errors, or missing elements``: Data wrangling plays a crucial role in preparing the data for the subsequent data mining process, which involves gathering and making sense of the data.
6. ``Facilitating concrete and timely decision-making for business users.``
7. ``Following a structured data wrangling process``: Typically, data wrangling software goes through iterative steps of discovery, structuring, cleaning, enriching, validating, and publishing the data before it is deemed ready for analytics.
