## Data Engineering
`Data Engineer` refers to a person who is responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the infrastructure that supports the storage, processing, and analysis of large volumes of data. To ensure that data is gathered, saved, and made accessible for use by data scientists and other stakeholders, data engineers employ a variety of technologies, including databases, data pipelines, and data warehouses. Data engineers are professionals in the design and implementation of data systems.

`Data Engineering` is a field that includes the process, tools, and techniques used to design, develop and maintain the systems and infrastructure that support the data needs of an organization. In order to make sure that data is available and accessible for analysis and decision-making, data engineering makes use of a variety of technologies, including databases, data pipelines, and data warehouses.

## Data Science
`Data Science` is an interdisciplinary field that includes the use of statistical and computational methods, machine learning, and other ways to extract knowledge and insight from data. Data science includes a range of activities, including data collection, cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization, which aims to find trends, forecast the future, and guide decision-making.

`Data Scientist` is a person who uses their skills and expertise in data science to solve complex problems by analyzing and interpreting large, complex datasets. Data scientists typically have a strong background in statistics, mathematics, and programming, and are able to develop and apply machine learning algorithms and other techniques to extract insights and knowledge from data.
