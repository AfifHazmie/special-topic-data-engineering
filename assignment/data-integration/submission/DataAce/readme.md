### 1. Identify three different data sources


### 2. Develop a plan for integrating data sources
Develop a plan for integrating these data sources into a unified dataset. This plan should include details on how you will map the data from each source onto a common schema, how you will handle missing or incomplete data, and any other data cleaning or transformation steps that will be necessary.

### 3. Implement your data integration plan
Implement your data integration plan using Python or another programming language of your choice. Your implementation should include code for loading data from each data source, mapping the data onto a common schema, and cleaning and transforming the data as needed.

### 4. Evaluate the success of your data integration plan. 
This should include a qualitative assessment of the quality and completeness of the integrated dataset, as well as any quantitative metrics that are relevant to your project.

### 5. Write a report summarizing your data integration plan and your results. 
This report should include a description of your data sources, a detailed explanation of your data integration plan, and an analysis of the success of your plan.
