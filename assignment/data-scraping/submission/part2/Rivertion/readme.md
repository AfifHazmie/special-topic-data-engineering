## 1. Introduction

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites, and it has become increasingly popular for research and analysis purposes. One type of data that is particularly valuable is publication content, as it provides insights into academic research and trends. In this assignment, we will explore web scraping publication content from a relevant website, such as Google Scholar.

## 2. Web Scraping Google Scholar

Google Scholar is a popular search engine for academic publications, making it an excellent source for web scraping data related to the Faculty of Computing at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. To scrape data from Google Scholar, we used Python and several libraries, including [google-search-results](https://pypi.org/project/google-search-results/) and [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/search-api). A challenge that we've encountered is that there are lots of metadata hidden which are not scrapable at the moment using SerpAPI.

## 3. Choosing a Library for Web Scraping

There are several libraries available for web scraping publication content, including Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium. We chose to use SerpAPI because it's very intuitive and user friendly and overall is alot easier to use than the other libraries since there are alot of built-in functions that are readily available to us.
