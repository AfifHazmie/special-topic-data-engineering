### 1.0 Introduction

Web scraping of publication content refers to the process of extracting data from academic and scientific articles, books, and other publications available online. This data can include information such as article titles, authors, abstracts, keywords, references, and full-text articles.

Web scraping publication content is important for research and analysis because it allows for large-scale data collection and analysis of scholarly literature. Researchers and analysts can use this data to identify patterns, trends, and gaps in the literature, and to explore relationships between different publications and authors.

Web scraping of publication content is particularly useful for meta-analyses, literature reviews, and other research studies that require a comprehensive overview of the available literature. It can also be used to identify emerging topics and new areas of research, as well as to track the impact of research over time.


### 2.0 Web Scraping Google Scholar

Google Scholar is a popular search engine that indexes scholarly literature, including articles, theses, books, and conference papers. Here are some reasons why it is a good source for publication content:

Comprehensive Coverage: Google Scholar has a vast collection of scholarly literature from a wide range of academic disciplines and sources, including academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, and universities.

Easy Access: Many of the publications indexed by Google Scholar are available in full-text format, making it easy for researchers and analysts to access the information they need.

Citation Metrics: Google Scholar also provides citation metrics for publications, which can be useful for evaluating the impact of research and identifying influential authors and articles.

Advanced Search: Google Scholar has an advanced search feature that allows users to search for specific keywords, authors, and publications, as well as to filter results by date, citation metrics, and other criteria.

Integration with Other Tools: Google Scholar can be integrated with other tools such as reference management software, allowing researchers to easily organize and cite their sources.

Overall, Google Scholar is a valuable source for publication content because of its comprehensive coverage, easy access, citation metrics, advanced search capabilities, and integration with other tools.

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) algorithm is widely used to solve many real world
problems by using the concept of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). However, major
disadvantages of BP are its convergence rate is relatively slow and always being
trapped at the local minima. To overcome this problem, Genetic Algorithm (GA) has
been used to determine optimal value for BP parameters such as learning rate and
momentum rate and also for weight optimization. In Backpropagation Neural
Network (BPNN), there are many elements to be considered such as the number of
input, hidden and output nodes, learning rate, momentum rate, bias, minimum error
and activation/transfer functions. All these elements will affect the speed of neural
network learning. Although GA is successfully improved BPNN learning, there are
still some issues such as longer training time to produce the output and usage of
complex functions in selection, crossover and mutation calculation. In this study, the
latest optimization algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is chosen and
applied in feedforward neural network to enhance the learning process in terms of
convergence rate and classification accuracy. Two programs have been developed;
Particle Swarm Optimization Feedforward Neural Network (PSONN) and Genetic
Algorithm Backpropagation Neural Network (GANN). The results show that
PSONN give promising results in term of convergence rate and classification
compared to GANN.
