## 1. Introduction 

Web scraping has become an increasingly popular technique for extracting useful information from the internet. With the rise of big data and the need for data-driven decision making, web scraping has become an essential tool for many businesses and organizations. One area where web scraping has proven particularly useful is in academic research. Google Scholar is a powerful resource for academics, but the sheer amount of data can make it difficult to extract the information you need.

In this context, web scraping can be used to automatically extract data from Google Scholar and other online sources. Therefore, for this project we will explore the topic of web scraping Google Scholar for Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. 

## 2. Choosing library - BeautifulSoup

Beautiful Soup is a popular web scraping library that can be used to extract data from HTML and XML files. When it comes to scraping Google Scholar for research data from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Beautiful Soup offers several benefits such as:

**Integration with other Python libraries:** Beautiful Soup can be easily integrated with other Python libraries, such as requests and pandas, for more advanced web scraping and data analysis tasks.

**Simplified parsing:** Beautiful Soup simplifies the process of parsing HTML and XML documents, making it easy to extract the data you need without getting bogged down in the details.

**Robust error handling:** Beautiful Soup can handle poorly formatted HTML and XML documents and can gracefully recover from errors, making it more reliable for web scraping projects.

## 3. Conclusion

In conclusion, web scraping has proven to be a powerful tool for collecting and analyzing data from various sources, including Google Scholar. By leveraging tools like Beautiful Soup, researchers can quickly extract large amounts of data for academic research purposes, such as evaluating the research output of specific institutions or identifying trends in research fields. Overall, the project demonstrates the usefulness of web scraping in collecting large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. The data collected can be used for various purposes, including academic research, market analysis, or trend analysis. However, it is important to note that web scraping must be done ethically and within legal boundaries, respecting the privacy and intellectual property rights of the source website and its users.
