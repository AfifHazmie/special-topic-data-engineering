## 1. Introduction

This assignment involves the use of the Pixabay API to retrieve 100 images based on a keyword entered by the user. The retrieved images will be stored in MongoDB along with their metadata. The process involves obtaining an API key from Pixabay, prompting the user to input a keyword, making a request to the Pixabay API using the API key and the user's keyword, parsing the JSON object returned by the API to extract relevant information, establishing a connection to MongoDB using PyMongo, creating a new database and collection to store image metadata, and creating a new document for each image in the collection. Finally, the images can be displayed to the user using a library such as Pillow or OpenCV. This assignment provides an opportunity to gain experience in working with APIs, parsing JSON data, and using MongoDB to store and retrieve data.

## 4. Storing Data in MongoDB

MongoDB provides several benefits when it comes to storing multimedia content data. One key advantage is its ability to handle unstructured data, such as multimedia files, in a flexible and scalable manner. This makes it easier to manage large volumes of multimedia content, and also allows for easy updates and modifications to the data. In relation to the previous summary, MongoDB can be used to store image metadata retrieved from the Pixabay API. The best way to store multimedia content data in MongoDB involves organizing the data into collections based on their type or purpose. Each document within the collection can contain metadata such as the filename, file type, file size, and other relevant information. To query and analyze the data, MongoDB provides a powerful set of tools that allow for filtering, sorting, and aggregation. For instance, one can query and analyze the image metadata stored in MongoDB to identify the most popular tags or image dimensions across all the retrieved images. Overall, MongoDB is an effective solution for storing and managing multimedia content data, offering flexibility, scalability, and powerful querying and analysis capabilities.
