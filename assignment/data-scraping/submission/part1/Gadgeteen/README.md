<h1 align="center"> Web Scraping </h1>

## 1. Introduction

Web scraping multimedia content refers to the process of automatically extracting and collecting images, videos, audio, and other types of multimedia data from websites. This type of data can be extremely valuable for research and analysis in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, marketing, and social media analysis.

Web scraping multimedia content can help researchers and analysts gain insights into visual and audio trends, sentiment analysis, and image recognition. For example, marketers can use image and video data to identify popular product trends or advertising strategies. Computer vision researchers can use large amounts of image data to train and improve machine learning models. Social media analysts can use multimedia content to monitor brand mentions and public opinion on social media platforms.
