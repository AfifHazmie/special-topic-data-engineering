<strong>Our goal: Extract data from an Application Programming Interface (API) through a client library (SDK). The data will then saved into a CSV file and uploaded into MongoDB database</strong>


<h3>Step 1: Get API key</h3>
We're interested in extracting Malaysia Today's News, hence we make use of the News API. This API extracts the news from Google News and we obtained the API key upon registering to the platform. 

<br>
<blockquote>Registration complete
  
Your API key is: 83bd643d7f9a468dabb080d927f260b3</blockquote>

<h3>Step 2: Choose Client Library</h3>
Since we have experiences in writing Python, we thought it would be easier to use Python for our client library (SDK). SDK helps us to quickly and easily get started with News API without having to make HTTP requests directly. To celebrate the collaboration within team members, we use Google Colab.

<h3>Step 3: Code</h3>
