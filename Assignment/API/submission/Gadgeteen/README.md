<h1 align="center"> Open Weather API </h1>

<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">Open Weather</a>  is a service that provides weather data through an API (Application Programming Interface). The OpenWeatherMap API allows developers to access current, forecast, and historical weather data for any location on Earth, as well as weather maps, satellite imagery, and other weather-related information.

With the Open Weather API, developers can integrate weather information into their applications, websites, and services. The API provides real-time weather data, hourly and daily forecasts, historical weather data, and more.

The Open Weather API uses a RESTful interface, which means that developers can interact with the API using standard HTTP methods, such as GET and POST, and retrieve data in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The API is available in both free and paid versions, with different levels of access and data limits.

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to collect weather data from the OpenWeather API using Python, and then save the collected data as an Excel file and also in MongoDB. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing weather trends or building weather forecasting models.

The project requires the use of an API key from OpenWeather, which is used to connect to their API and collect weather data. Once the data is collected, it is saved as an Excel file using Python's pandas library, and also saved in MongoDB using the PyMongo library.

Overall, this assignment requires knowledge of Python programming, working with APIs, data manipulation with pandas, and working with MongoDB.

## Library used

The library we have used is `requests`, `csv` , `datetime` and `json`

- `requests` is used to send a HTTP to server and retrieve data from it,
- `csv` is used to manipulate csv,
- `json` is used to manipulate csv,
- `datetime` is used to get the current date and time

```python
import requests
import json
import csv
from datetime import datetime
```

## Fetching data using Open Weather API

1. Go to the OpenWeatherMap website at <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">https://openweathermap.org/</a> and click on the "Sign up" button in the top right corner of the page.

2. Fill in your details, including your email address and a password, and then click on the "Create Account" button.

3. Once you have created an account, log in to the OpenWeatherMap website using your email address and password.

4. Click on the "API Keys" tab in the navigation menu at the top of the page.

5. Click on the "Generate new API key" button.

6. Give your API key a name and select the API plan that you want to use.

7. Click on the "Generate" button to create your API key.

8. Your API key will now be displayed on the screen. Make sure to copy it and keep it in a safe place, as you will need it to access the OpenWeatherMap API.

9. Paste your API Key in the code below.

```python
# Enter your API key here
api_key = "d818e156d080744b840822d35e60eefe"

# Define the states and their respective coordinates
states = {
    "Johor": {"lat": 1.9344, "lon": 103.3587},
    "Kedah": {"lat": 6.1254, "lon": 100.3673},
    "Kelantan": {"lat": 6.1274, "lon": 102.2385},
    "Kuala Lumpur": {"lat": 3.1390, "lon": 101.6869},
    "Labuan": {"lat": 5.2767, "lon": 115.2417},
    "Melaka": {"lat": 2.1896, "lon": 102.2501},
    "Negeri Sembilan": {"lat": 2.7297, "lon": 101.9381},
    "Pahang": {"lat": 3.9319, "lon": 103.0044},
    "Penang": {"lat": 5.4149, "lon": 100.3298},
    "Perak": {"lat": 4.5908, "lon": 101.0804},
    "Perlis": {"lat": 6.4553, "lon": 100.4141},
    "Sabah": {"lat": 5.9804, "lon": 116.0735},
    "Sarawak": {"lat": 1.5497, "lon": 110.3634},
    "Selangor": {"lat": 3.0738, "lon": 101.5183},
    "Terengganu": {"lat": 5.3117, "lon": 103.1324}
}

# Define the API endpoint URL
url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"
```

## Get the current date and time
```python
current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
```

## Create a list to store the weather data for each state
```python
weather_data = []
```

## Loop through each state and retrieve the weather data
```python
for state, coords in states.items():
    # Define the API parameters
    params = {
        "lat": coords["lat"],
        "lon": coords["lon"],
        "appid": api_key,
        "units": "metric"
    }
    
    # Send a GET request to the API endpoint
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)

    # Check for any API errors
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print(f"Error: {response.json()['message']}")
        continue

    # Parse the JSON response
    data = json.loads(response.content)

    # Retrieve the necessary weather information
    temperature = data.get("main", {}).get("temp")
    humidity = data.get("main", {}).get("humidity")
    wind_speed = data.get("wind", {}).get("speed")
    description = data.get("weather", [{}])[0].get("description")

    # Add the weather data to the list
    weather_data.append([state, current_time, temperature, humidity, wind_speed, description])
```

## Save the weather data to a CSV file
```python
with open("weather_data.csv", "w", newline="") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(["State", "Date and Time", "Temperature (C)", "Humidity (%)", "Wind Speed (m/s)", "Description"])
    writer.writerows(weather_data)
```

## Print a message indicating that the data has been saved
```python
print("Weather data has been saved to weather_data.csv")
```

## Print the data collected from the API

```python
for state, coords in states.items():
      # Print the weather information for the state
    print(f"State: {state}")
    print(f"Date and Time: {current_time}")
    print(f"Temperature: {temperature}Â°C")
    print(f"Humidity: {humidity}%")
    print(f"Wind speed: {wind_speed} m/s")
    print(f"Description: {description}")
    print("="*30)
```

## Store the collected data in MongoDB database

Install and import pymongo library to interact with the MongoDB database.

```python
pip install pymongo
```

```python
import pymongo
```

Create a connection to the MongoDB database using the pymongo library and MongoDB database credentials including the Mongo URI, database name and collection name.

```python
# Create a new MongoDB client
client = pymongo.MongoClient(mongo_uri)

# Select the database
db = client["<database>"]

# Select the collection
collection = db["<collection>"]
```

After collecting the data from API, arrange the data needed in dictionary format and use `insert_one()` method to insert the document into the collection of the database.

```python
document = {
    "state": state,
    "date_time": current_time,
    "temperature": temperature,
    "humidity": humidity,
    "wind_speed": wind_speed,
    "description": description
}

collection.insert_one(document)
```

The image below shows the MongoDB Compass screenshot of documents successfully inserted into the collection of database.
