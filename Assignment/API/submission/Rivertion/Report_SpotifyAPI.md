# Spotify API
## Part 1: Retrieving the data using the API
### Step 1: Importing libraries
First, we `import` the necessary library needed to start retrieving data which in this case is the `requests` library which is used for making HTTP requests. It allows the code to interact with the Spotify API to retrieve information

```python
import requests
```
### Step 2: 
## Part 2: Uploading .csv file to MongoDB
### Step 1: Install database library
This is the most significant stage since it will provide us with a list of libraries that we will need to link our database. 

### Step 2: Create database
In this stage, we set a new database in MongoDB Compass and name it, followed by the creation of a collection within the database.

### Step 3: import library and declare Variable
In this step, we import the library we just loaded and define three key variables: client (connection string), database, and collection.

### Step 4: Insert the record into MongoDB
declare variable names based on csv table columns
